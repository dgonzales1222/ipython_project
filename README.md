# Growing Degree Days (GDD) and Crop Phenology Estimation

## Project Description

This project implements a python-based tool to compute the growing degree days (GDD) and determine the current crop growth stage (phenology) for selected vegetable and field crops. The model uses daily air temperature data retrieved from Open-Meteo API and applies crop-specific thermal thresholds derived from FAO56 revised guidelines (FAO56rev).

Unlike cropping calendar-based approaches, this project estimates crop development using cumulative thermal time, providing a biologically meaningful presentation of crop growth.
